    <h5>What is this?</h5>

    <p id="summary">Something I have been involved in during the past few months is The HeadBandproject, which is a collective effort to provide healthcare personnel and other essential workers with headbands free of cost that are made to alleviate ear discomfort that may come up after wearing PPE for extended periods of time.</p>

    <p id="stats">With the help of volunteers, we have successfully reached over 10+ hospitals with over 1200+ headbands amidst the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

    <p>Some hospitals we have been able to provide for include: UCLA Medical Center, UCI Medical Center, Kaiser, Stanford Health Care, and many more!</p>

    <h5>My Role and Experience</h5>

    <p>For the past three months, I have served as the Media Executive, in which I manage a small team to create and deploy graphics for use in our communications and social media platforms. To say the least, this experience has been extremely rewarding. I have learned a lot from distributing tasks, making my visualizations more concrete, critiquing work, and team building. Both my board and media team has been amazing to work with, and it is mindblowing how much has been accomplished and built by people that slowly came together.</p>
